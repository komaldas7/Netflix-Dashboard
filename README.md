Excel and Power BI dashboard

I analyze the dataset using Excel and Power BI to create a Netflix dashboard. The process involved several essential steps to ensure that the data was thoroughly cleaned, and organized, and provided significant insights.

Data Cleaning and Preparation:
- Removed Unnecessary Columns: Identified and eliminated columns that were not essential for the analysis.
- Renamed Columns: Revised the column names to enhance clarity and familiarity.
- Set Data Types: Ensured that each column had the correct data type, such as dates and numerical values.
- Cleaned Data: Managed empty and null values by either filling them with default values or removing them if deemed insignificant.

Created Columns: Implemented new columns to yield additional insights.
Organized Models: Structured the models by organizing columns using attributes and hiding those utilized solely for calculations or intermediate steps.
- Renamed in Modeling: Ensured that all columns were appropriately named for ease of use.

 I developed insightful charts, including geographical charts depicting the distribution of Netflix titles by country. Additionally, I implemented DAX to create data labels colors for fill and font based on ratings for movies and TV shows. It's an insight dashboard that helps end users analyze the data.
